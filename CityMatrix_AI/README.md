## Instructions

#### A. City Generation

Generate a given amount of cities. In order to do this, you can run the `CityGenerator.java` script and set the numberCities variable as you wish. Two sub-notes:
  - This script requires the local JAR libarary for JSON processing, which can be found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8997598/importing-json-into-an-eclipse-project).
  - **You must create the a directory named `out` before running this script that is one directory above your working `CityGenerator.java` file.**

This will produce JSON city configuration files in the `../out/` directory.
